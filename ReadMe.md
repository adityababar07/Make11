# Levels

>Level 1: A player is dealt 5 cards from a shuffled deck. The hand of cards is displayed in the
console.

>Level 2: The computer deals a card from the deck and the user selects a card from the hand to
Make 11. If Make 11 is achieved, the user scores one point and their card is replaced
with one from the deck.

>Level 3: The game continues until the player is unable to Make 11, when the total score is
displayed.

>Level 4: If a player is unable to Make 11 but can play a card of the same suit as the computer,
the game can continue, but no point is scored for that round.

>Level 5: If the player can Make 11, they can opt to also play any picture cards in their hand so
that they are replaced by cards from the deck.

>Level 6: All user input is validated so that only valid input is possible. An empty deck causes the
game to end.

>Level 7: A high-score table holding the player’s name and score for the 5 highest scores is
implemented. If a new game results in a score that qualifies for the high score table,
the player is asked for their name and the new entry is inserted into the appropriate
place in the table. Where the new score equals the lowest score in the table, it should
replace the existing entry. The high score table is made available for display before
each new game is played and after a new high score entry is recorded.

>Level 8: Following each game, the player is offered the opportunity to view a replay which
displays for each round the player’s hand, the computer’s card, the card(s) played by
the player and the outcome.
